# Introduction

Only heavy crimes such as first degree murder, second degree murder, infanticide or manslaughter are considered homicide. The definition of homicide is usually consistent across nations. Hence, compared to any other crimes, homicide has more international consensus on the meaning and nature of homicide. Therefore, it is important to examine homicide since it is considered as a "comparable and reliable barometer of violence in society". 

As severe as it is, homicide is relatively rare in Canada compared to other countries, but in recent years, Canada's homicide rate has been higher. However, due to COVID-19, there has been stay-at-home measures and encouraged "physical distancing". This caused people to spend more time at home and caused businesses to close temporarily or adapt to different methods of services. These changes in society and economy has led to a shift in crime patterns across Canada. This report will help identify such shifts in crime patterns in Toronto and the different motivational factors that could lead to homicide.

The data originates from the Toronto Open Data Portal, which is the official source for Toronto Open Data from city divisions and agencies. The objective of Open Data is to help make the city more accountable, transparent, participatory and accessible. This paper includes data set on police annual statistical report on homicides. The original data includes event unique id, hood id, division, homicide type, object id, id, geometry, neighbourhood, occurrence date, and occurrence year. However, this report will focus on the division, hood ID, homicide type, neighbourhood, occurrence date, and occurrence year. The data set is converted into a usable data set with R using only the information that is necessary for analysis. 

The paper begins by explaining the motivation behind the data and the analysis. Followed by the composition of the data obtained from the Toronto Open Data Portal. Afterwards, we go in depth about the methodology. Our data section contains plots that summarize the variables and an accompanying discussion. Followed by graphs generated from simulated data and its implications to understand how homicide occurrences changed over the years and to identify patterns to Toronto's homicide occurrences. The paper concludes with an explanation of possible weaknesses and limitations. 

# Data

The data is obtained from the Toronto Open Data Portal, which is an open source delivery tool that allows people to access data. The Open Data Portal for Toronto first launched in 2009. It consists of various useful datasets, which is updated regularly for more accurate and practical information. 

The data used for our analysis is the 'Police Annual Statistical Report - Homicides'. The dataset includes all homicide occurrences in Toronto from 2004 to 2020. As mentioned earlier, it contains event unique id, hood id, division, homicide type, object id, id, geometry, neighbourhood, occurrence date, and occurrence year. However, the dataset is cleaned to make analysis more clear and simple. 

Also, this data has limitations. In order to protect the privacy of the involved people in the occurrences, the location of the occurrences have been offset to the nearest road intersection. This can possibly affect the count of occurrences reported since it may not reflect the geographies accurately.


# Results and Discussion

The plots below summarize the variables in our dataset, which show the trends in homicide occurrences in Toronto. Figure 1 shows the distribution of homicide types in total. It shows that the number of shooting occurrences are the highest compared to stabbing and other types of homicide. Figure 2 shows the same pattern where each year, there is most number of shooting occurrences compared to the other homicide types. However, Figure 2 also displays an up and down pattern over the years. Starting from 2004 there is an increase until 2007. Since 2007 there is a decrease until 2012 where it starts increasing again until 2018. After 2018, the number of homicide occurrences starts to decrease once more. It is assumed that COVID-19 has an affect on such decrease in recent years from 2019. Figure 3 represents the distribution of homicide occurrences according to police divisions. The graphs show that 31 Division has the most number of homicide occurrences. It is noticeable that divisions in the edge of Toronto generally have more number of homicide occurrences compared to divisions in the central area of Toronto.

## Weaknesses and next steps

There are some possible weaknesses in regards to this analysis. The data has limitations. In order to protect the privacy of the involved people in the occurrences, the location of the occurrences have been offset to the nearest road intersection. This can possibly affect the count of occurrences reported since it may not reflect the geographies accurately.

	- The instances represent the homicide occurrences. 
	
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- There are 1166 instances. 
	
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- It is not representative of the larger se because it needs to cover a more diverse range of instances.
	
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- There is no label or targe associated with each instance.
	
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
